        Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed through some interesting places on th way:

        <ol>
            <li>Walla Walla, WA</li>
            <li>Magic City, ID</li>
            <li>Bontiful, UT</li>
            <li>Last Chance, CO</li>
            <li>Why, AZ</li>
            <li>Truth or Concenquences, NM</li>
        </ol>
    </p>

        I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:
    </p>
        <blockquote>
            Passing cars, <br>
            when you can't see, <br>
            May get you, <br>
            A glimpse, <br>
            Of eternity. <br>
        </blockquote>
    <p>
        I definitely won't be passing any cars. :-)

        My first day of the trip!  I can't believe I finally got everyting paced and ready t go.  Becuae I'm on a Segway, I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me: 
        <ul>
            <li>Cell Phone</li>
            <li>Ipod</li>
            <li>Digital Camera</li>
            <li>Protein Bar</li>
        </ul>
    Just the essentials.  As Lao Tzu would have said <q>A journey of a thousand miles begins with one step Segway</q>
    </p>

    <P>
        You never know when you'll need a good quote quote, how about <q>To be or not to be</q>, or <q>Wherever you go, there you are</q>.
    </P>
